			<p>With the rise of digitalization, new opportunities and new players are challenging the film and TV industry. Insights from smart analyses of big data are poised to become a central element of the industry’s value creation.</p>
			<p>Scholars from several disciplines (incl. marketing, management, and economics) have been exploring the power of big datasets and econometric models for some decades. Their findings have been largely overlooked by an industry that is traditionally characterized by Goldman’s “Nobody knows anything” mantra.</p>
			<p>This conference intends to showcase key and novel findings from scholarly research that can provide rich insights into what is required to make successful films and TV series/shows these days.</p>
			<p>How can these insights be of value in an industry that is characterized by creativity and intuition?</p>
