        "With the rise of digitalization, the film industry has been challenged by new opportunities and new players which have turned insights from smart analyses of big data into a central element of the industry’s value creation. Scholars from several disciplines, including marketing, management, and economics, have been exploring the power of big datasets and econometric models for some decades, but their insights have been largely overlooked by an industry that is traditionally characterized by Goldman’s “Nobody knows anything” mantra. This conference intends to showcase key and novel findings from scholarly research that can provide rich insights into what is required to make successful films and TV series/shows these days. How can these insights be of value in an industry that is characterized by creativity and intuition?"
